  "aboutText": "BVH Wood creations was started by me, Bryce Hansen, and my love for all things wood. I started working with wood in high school, and I immediately fell in love. Although much of my training has come formally, my favorite teachings have been through many fellow woodturners.  I grew my network and met these special men at Wasatch Pen Turners Club as they shared their skills, talents, and love for wood with me. They have mentored me in every aspect, helping me improve with every new project. Their kindness has changed my life, and made me the woodturner I am today.  BVH Wood Creations uses the artful skills of the past to inspire growth in the future, all through the beauty of wood. Our handmade quality will inspire creativity and provoke joy to all! ",
